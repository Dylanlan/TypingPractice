TypingPractice

Program to practice typing

Running this program will open a form to practice typing in. It will display either a QWERTY or Dvorak keyboard
to help remember the keyboard layout. It allows the user to pick the number of minutes of the timer, and even records a high score for the fastest QWERTY and Dvorak typing speeds!

The text you need to type will appear right above the textbox. The next letter that needs to be typed will be highlighted
in green, and any errors you type will be coloured in red. Once a sentence is completed, the background will change to green, and pressing enter will generate the next sentence to be typed.

Note that the word list and high score files use relative paths, so you might need to move them around depending where you put the executable

Future features:
- More statistics information at the end of typing sessions, such as common errors
- Coloring of the displayed keyboard to show what needs to be typed, or what was just typed
