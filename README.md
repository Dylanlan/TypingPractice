TypingPractice
==============

Program to practice typing

Running this program will open a form to practice typing in. It will display either a QWERT or Dvorak keyboard
to help remember the key spots. It allows the user to pick the timer, and even records a high score for the fastest
QWERTY and Dvorak typing speeds!

The text you need to type will appear right above the textbox. The next letter that needs to be typed will be highlighted
in green, and any errors you type will be coloured in red.

Future features:
- Better wordlist
- Better functionality for when the timer runs out
